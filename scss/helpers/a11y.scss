/*
From https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/forms/labels/#note-on-hiding-elements

Hide elements visually but not from screen readers/assistive technology.
Elements with this class are technically visible but practically hidden.
Note that interactive elements are still active when using this code, so it
is not suitable to hide other parts of forms but the labels.
